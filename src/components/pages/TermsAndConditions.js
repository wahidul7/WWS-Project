          any end-user or other third-party, and in no event will Customer be
          relieved of Customer’s payment obligation(s) to World Wireless

          failure or inability of Customer to collect payment from any
          third-party.

          any shortages or non-conforming Products, the Products will be
          considered accepted. Customer will have the exclusive responsibility
          for filing claims for cargo loss, damage, or delay (“Cargo Claims”)

          date the shipment should have been delivered. Lawsuits for cargo loss,
          damage or delay must be filed no later than two years from the date a
          claim is denied, in whole or in part, by the transportation provider.
          <br />
          <br /> Returns.
          <br />
          <br /> Customer may only return Products as permitted in these General
          Terms. Products are otherwise non-returnable, and the prices and fees
          are non-refundable. Products damaged after receipt may not be
          returned. In order to be eligible to receive credit for returned
          Products, Customer must adhere to World Wireless Solutions’s current
          returns processing guidelines. Customer must obtain a valid return

          Product packaging and for complying with all other World Wireless

          Product returns from Customer are FOB destination World Wireless
          Solutions’s designated facility, and title and risk of loss will
          transfer to World Wireless Solutions upon receipt and acceptance of
          returned Products at World Wireless Solutions’s facility. World

          clearly visible RMA. Except for defective or damaged Products, all
          Products must be returned with the original packaging intact
          (including manufacturer’s shrink wrap) and otherwise in unused,
          resalable condition. Credit will be provided for Product returned in
          accordance with World Wireless Solutions’s return policies at the time
          the RMA is issued. If Customer returns any Products without World
          Wireless Solutions’s authorization or does not comply with World
          Wireless Solutions’s return requirements, those Products may be
          subject to return to the shipping location and, if refused, World
          Wireless Solutions may consider the Products abandoned and dispose of
          them, without crediting Customer’s account. World Wireless Solutions
          may charge a restocking fee for handling any Product that is not
          returned in accordance with these General Terms. World Wireless
          Solutions’s sole liability for any returned Products will be
          acceptance of their return and issuance of credits pursuant to World
          Wireless Solutions’s returns processing guidelines. <br />

          <br /> Except for any announcement intended solely for internal
          distribution by either party or any disclosure required by legal,
          accounting, or regulatory requirements, all media releases, public
          announcements, or public disclosures by either party or its employees
          or agents relating to these General Terms, the relationship between
          World Wireless Solutions and Customer, or including the marks of the
          other party or any affiliate of that party, must be approved in
          writing by the other party prior to release. <br />
          <br /> Public Sector.
          <br />
          <br /> When purchasing Products for resale to or in support of public
          sector customers, including those in the federal, state, and local
          governments and education markets, Customer agrees to provide all
          applicable public sector customer requirements to World Wireless
          Solutions at the time that Customer requests a quote or places an
          order. The Customer will send those terms to World Wireless Solutions,
          along with the order or request for quote including the procuring or
          receiving government agency and if available the applicable prime
          contract number. World Wireless Solutions’s receipt of those terms
          does not constitute acceptance of said terms or acceptance of an
          order. Questions regarding acceptance of flow-down terms and
          conditions should be directed to World Wireless Solutions at
          publicsector_programs@ingrammicro.com. Customer understands and agrees
          that World Wireless Solutions is a distributor of “Commercial Items”
          as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”) 2.101. Customer
          further agrees that, for federal contracts, Customer will only
          flow-down to World Wireless Solutions the clauses that are required to
          be inserted in a subcontract for Commercial Items, as set forth in FAR
          52.244-6(c)(1) or an applicable agency FAR supplement. To the extent
          that Customer believes that additional FAR and/or agency FAR
          supplemental clauses apply because they are mandatory flow-downs to
          which the Customer has agreed to with its federal government customer,
          Customer will list those clauses, and the basis for their inclusion,
          in the email to World Wireless Solutions. Customer will receive only
          those rights in technical data provided by the Vendors. In no event
          will Customer receive unlimited rights in data, software, or
          intellectual property rights provided by the Vendors or any other
          third party.
          <br />
          <br />
          Support, Site Access, and Security Requirements.
          <br />
          <br /> When purchasing Products for resale, and to ensure proper
          implementation, warranty, service, and support of the customer
          environment, Customer agrees to provide written guidance of any
          security requirements for access to facilities, systems, and networks
          that is necessary for Customer’s performance of an order. The guidance
          should outline all the security requirements associated with
          information, networks and systems being supported and accessed
          including requirements for personnel. In the case of public sector
          customers including any Federal, State or Local Government agency,
          Prime Contractor or Subcontractor, the Customer must provide the same
          written guidance of any security requirements as stated above and
          include all applicable security forms and contract flow down clauses.
          All contracts and orders for Federal Government customers must provide
          security guidance in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations,
          including but not limited to FAR clause 52.204-2, Security
          Requirements and FAR Subpart 4.4 – Safeguarding Classified Information
          within Industry, by providing a Form DD-254 when applicable. The
          security guidance provided will be coordinated through World Wireless
          Solutions’s Security Office and all applicable requirements will be
          communicated to the Vendor. It is expected that all security
          requirements and guidelines will be specified to include issuance of a
          Form DD-254 where needed. The requirements will be provided to and
          extend to all subcontractors and will cover the entire period of
          performance including the full warranty support period for the
          solution provided. <br />
          <br /> Data Privacy.
          <br />
          <br /> Customer hereby grants World Wireless Solutions and the
          applicable Vendors a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free,
          worldwide right to use the electronic data specifically pertaining to

          agrees that Customer has received proper consent from Customer’s
          customers to provide their information to World Wireless Solutions and
          Vendors for use in connection with Products or Customer complies with
          an alternative legal basis for providing their information to World
          Wireless Solutions. By Customer’s or Customer’s customers’ use of the
          Products, Customer agrees that World Wireless Solutions may process
          Data in accordance with our Privacy Statement, available at (Privacy
          Statement). Customer or Customer’s customers’ use of Products may also
          be subject to the privacy policies of the Vendor.
          <br />
          <br /> Intellectual Property.
          <br />
          <br /> Nothing herein grants any rights to either party in any
          intellectual property of the other except for the limited rights
          expressly set forth herein. Any property developed by you using
          Services performed by World Wireless Solutions belong to World

          relates such Services to Customer’s or a third party’s environment)
          used or developed for interacting with such Services.
          <br />
          <br /> Inspection of Records.
          <br />
          <br /> Customer will permit the inspection of all records pertaining
          to the business relationship with World Wireless Solutions by

          notify Customer of its desire to inspect its records at least 10 days
          in advance.

          <br /> Restrictions.
          <br />
          <br />
          Customer agrees to adhere to all applicable Vendor terms and
          conditions, channel policies and program requirements, including
          without limitation, Vendor’s restrictions regarding Product use,
          distribution, resale, prohibited customers, territory, etc. Customer
          is solely responsible for ensuring its adherence to any and all such
          restrictions. Customer may not alter or modify the Products in any way
          or combine the Products with any other product or material not
          authorized by World Wireless Solutions and/or the Vendor, as
          applicable.
          <br />
          <br /> General. <br />
          <br /> Neither party will be responsible for delays in performance due

          flood, tornado, earthquake, war, riot, insurrection, strike, lockout,
          slowdown, epidemic, quarantine restriction, delay in transportation,

          performance. Each party agrees to abide by all laws and regulations
          applicable to its performance of its obligations under these General
          Terms. Neither party has made, and will not make, any direct or

          gift, promise to give, or authorization of the giving, of anything of
          value to any government official, or the immediate family of any such

          government or such individual in order to assist, directly or
          indirectly, Customer or World Wireless Solutions in obtaining or
          retaining business, or securing an improper advantage. If Customer
          delivers the Products to its customer who may use the Products outside
          the United States, Customer will advise its customer that the Products
          are controlled for export by the U.S. Department of Commerce and that
          the Products may require authorization prior to export from the United
          States or re-export. Customer and World Wireless Solutions are
          independent contractors. Nothing stated in these General Terms will be
          construed as creating the relationship of employer/employee,
          franchisor/franchisee, partners, or principal/agent between the
          parties. Neither party will make any warranty, guarantee or
          representation, whether written or oral, on the other party’s behalf.

          Customer may not assign or delegate its rights or duties under these
          General Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, in whole or in part,
          without the prior written consent of World Wireless Solutions. Any
          direct or indirect change of control of Customer will be deemed an

          of the remaining provisions will not in any way be affected. Failure
          or delay of either party to exercise a right under these General Terms
          will not operate as a waiver, nor will any single or partial exercise
          of a right preclude any other future exercise of that right. The
          parties agree to use electronic signatures and that their respective
          electronic signatures will be legally enforceable. No termination of
          these General Terms will affect any rights or obligations of either
