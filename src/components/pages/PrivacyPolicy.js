        </p>
        <p>
          Generally, the cookies that are used on the Website can be broken down
          into the following categories:
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Strictly necessary cookies. </u>These are cookies that are required
          for the operation of our Website. They include, for example, cookies

          <br />
          <u>Analytical/performance cookies. </u> These cookies are used to
          analyze how the Website is used and to monitor its performance, which
          allows us to improve your experience in using the Website. These
          cookies help us to tailor the content of Website to reflect what users
          find most interesting and to identify when technical issues with the

          and how we can improve the Website.
          <br />
          <u>Functional/tracking cookies.</u> These cookies enable us to
          recognize repeat visitors to our Websites. By matching an anonymous,
          randomly generated identifier, a tracking cookie keeps track of where
          a user of our Websites came from, what search engine they may have
          used, what link they clicked on, what keyword they used and where they
          were in the world when they accessed the Website. By monitoring this
          data, we can make improvements to our Website.
          <br />
          <u>Targeting cookies.</u> These cookies record your visit to our

          this information with third parties for this purpose. The above
          cookies can be either session cookies or persistent cookies:
        </p>
        <p>
          <u> Session cookies.</u>
          These cookies are used ‘in-session’ each time you visit and then
          expire when you leave a Website or shortly thereafter: they are not
          stored on your Device permanently, do not contain any Personal Data,
          and help by minimizing the need to transfer Personal Data across the
          internet. These cookies can be deleted, or you can refuse to allow
          their use, but this will hamper the performance and your experience in
          using the Website. These cookies also take time stamps that record
          when you access the Website and when you leave the Website.
          <br />

          This type of cookie is saved on your Device for a fixed period
          (sometimes for a few hours, sometimes for a year or longer) and is not
          deleted when the browser is closed. Persistent cookies are used where
          we need to remember who you are for more than one browsing session.
          For example, this type of cookie can be used to store your language
          preferences, so that they are remembered for the next visit to the

          electronic image embedded in the Website interface that allows us to
          recognize when you visit that area of the Website. These may also be
          used in connection with some Website pages and HTML-formatted email
          messages to, among other things, track the actions of Website users
          and e-mail recipients, measure the success of our marketing campaigns,
          and compile statistics about Website usage and email response rates.
        </p>

          third parties when you choose to affirmatively click their “widgets”

          We may access and use information from credit reference and denied
          party agencies when you open your account and periodically to:
        </p>
        <p>

          be taken based solely on automated checks of information from credit
          reference agencies and internal records
        </p>
        <p>
          We will continue to share information with credit reference agencies
          about how you manage your account including any default in making
          payments, while you have a relationship with us. This information will
          be made available to other organizations so that they can take
          decisions about you.

        <p>
          A record of any fraud or money laundering risk will be retained by the

          verify identity, in order to protect their business and to comply with
          laws that apply to them.

          Offering), (ii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests
          and not overridden by your rights, or (iii) where we have your consent
          to do so. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to
          collect Personal Data from you or may otherwise need the Personal Data
          to protect your vital interests or those of another person.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we ask you to provide Personal Data to comply with a legal
          requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear
          at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your
          Personal Data is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible
          consequences if you do not provide your Personal Data).
        </p>
        <p>
          If we collect and use your Personal Data in reliance on our legitimate
          interests (or those of any third-party), this interest will normally
          be to operate our platform and communicating with you as necessary to
          provide our services and Offerings to you, and for our legitimate
          commercial interest, for instance, when responding to your queries,
          improving our platform, undertaking marketing, or for the purposes of
          detecting or preventing illegal activities. We may have other
          legitimate interests, and if appropriate, we will make clear to you at
          the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we collect and use your Personal Data based upon your consent, the
          consequences of denying or withdrawing consent will be made known at
          the time your consent is provided.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have questions about or need further information concerning the
          legal basis on which we collect and use your Personal Data, please

          Policy: identifiers and personal information categories listed in Cal.

          information (such as details of the Offerings and services you
          purchase, your marketing preferences, and your survey responses);
          internet or other electronic network activity information (such as
          your interactions with our Website); geolocation data (but not precise
          geolocation); professional information (such as your company
          affiliation and job title); sensitive personal information (namely,
          your payment card details, World Wireless Solutions account login
          details, and government identification numbers); and inferences. See
          Section 2 above for more details.
          <br /> We use the above-described categories of personal information
          for our compliance, business and commercial purposes described in
          Section 4 above. We collect these categories of personal information
          from the following categories of sources, as more fully described in
          Section 2 above: directly from you; automatically from your Devices;
          from other users of the Website, from resellers and distributors that
          resell our Offerings, from vendors that make Offerings available
          through us, from our service providers who help us run our business,
          from third-party customers that contract with us for services, from
          data providers and data licensors, from publicly available sources,
          and from our Affiliates and Subsidiaries.
          <br /> We disclose each of the foregoing categories of personal
          information to our Affiliates and Subsidiaries, to our service
          providers who help us run our business, to advertisers who advertise
          on our Platform, to advertising networks, to resellers and
          distributors of the Offerings, to data analytics providers, to other
          Website visitors (at your direction), with entities for legal
          compliance purposes, and with potential acquirers of parts of our
          business. See Section 5 above for more details.
          <br /> We may “sell” or “share” some of the following categories of
          personal information: identifiers; personal information categories
          listed in Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.80(e); commercial information;
          Internet or other electronic network activity; and geolocation data.
          We sell and share this personal information with advertisers,
          advertising networks, social networks, other business partners and
          Affiliates and Subsidiaries. We do not knowingly sell or share the
          personal information of individuals under 16 years of age.
          <br /> We do not use or disclose sensitive personal information for
          purposes other than those specified under applicable California
          privacy regulations. See Section 11 for information about how long we
          retain Personal Data.
          <br /> California’s “Shine the Light” law also provides that
          California residents have a right to request that businesses tell them
          how their personal information has been shared with third parties for
          their direct marketing purposes. There is an exception to this
          requirement for businesses that have adopted and disclosed, in their
          privacy policy, a policy of not disclosing a person’s personal
          information to third parties for direct marketing purposes if that
          person has exercised an option to opt-out of the disclosure of their
          Personal Data to third parties for such purposes. We have adopted a
          policy of allowing you to opt-out of the disclosure of your personal
          information to third parties for direct marketing purposes and thus
          fall within this exception. To opt-out of the sharing of your personal
          information to third parties for direct marketing purposes or
          otherwise exercise your rights under this section, please contact us
          using the contact details provided under the “Questions and Contact
          information” heading below.

          <h2>Other Important Privacy Information </h2>
          <u>Security of Personal Data.</u>
          World Wireless Solutions uses technical and organization controls and
          measures designed to secure and protect your Personal Data from
          unauthorized loss, misuse, and disclosure, such as strong user access
          controls, segmented network architecture, and comprehensive employee
          policies and training. Unfortunately, no data transmitted over or
          accessible through the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
          As a result, while World Wireless Solutions attempts to protect all
          Personal Data, World Wireless Solutions cannot ensure or warrant that
          Personal Data will be completely secure from misappropriation by
          hackers or from other nefarious or criminal activities, or in the
          event of a failure of computer hardware, software, or a
          telecommunications network. World Wireless Solutions will notify you
          in the event we become aware of a security breach involving your
          personally identifiable information (as defined by the applicable
          foreign, federal, state, and local laws) stored by or for us, in
          accordance with applicable laws.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Compliance.</u> World Wireless Solutions will use a self-assessment
          approach to verify compliance with this Privacy Statement and
          periodically verify that the Privacy Statement is accurate,
          comprehensive for the information intended to be covered, prominently
          displayed, implemented and accessible. If you believe that your
          Personal Data has been processed or disclosed in violation of this
          Privacy Statement, World Wireless Solutions encourages you to raise
          any concerns using the contact information provided in this Privacy
          Statement under the “Questions and Contact information” heading below.
          World Wireless Solutions will investigate and attempt to resolve any
          complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of Personal Data.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Accuracy.</u> It is your responsibility to provide World Wireless
          Solutions with accurate Personal Data. Except as otherwise set forth
          in this Privacy Statement, World Wireless Solutions shall only use
          Personal Data in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which
          it was collected or subsequently authorized by you. To the extent
          necessary for these purposes, World Wireless Solutions shall take
          reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Data is accurate, complete,
          current and relevant to its intended use.
        </p>
        <h2>International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>
          Your Personal Data may be transferred to, and processed in, countries
          other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may
          have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your
          country.
        </p>
        <p>
          Specifically, our primary Website servers are in the United States,
          and our Subsidiaries and third-party service providers and partners
          operate around the world. This means that when we collect your
          Personal Data we may process it in any of these countries. However, we
          have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your Personal Data
          will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Statement. For
          Personal Data collected in the countries of the European Economic Area
          and/or the UK and transferred or accessed by World Wireless Solutions
          in the United States, World Wireless Solutions, Inc. has executed the
          European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses and their UK and
          Swiss equivalents in addition to appropriate technical and
          organization controls.
        </p>
        <p>
          For additional transfers of Personal Data between our Subsidiaries
          outside the EEA and/or the UK and the United States we have
          implemented the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses and
          their UK and Swiss equivalents in addition to appropriate technical
          and organization controls, which require us to protect Personal Data
          they process from the EEA or the UK in accordance with European Union
          and UK data protection law as applicable. We have implemented similar
          appropriate safeguards with our third-party service providers and
          partners .
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Retention Period</b>
          We retain each of the categories of Personal Data (including Sensitive
          Personal Data) for as long as we have an ongoing legitimate business
          need to do so (for example, to provide you with an Offering you have
          requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting
          requirements). The criteria we use to determine whether we have an
          ongoing legitimate business need to retain Personal Data include among
          others: (i) regulatory requirements that we are subject to, including
          laws and regulations related to tax, employment, accounting, and
          securities, (ii) whether a legal claim might be brought against us,
          for which the Personal Data would be relevant, (iii) the necessity of
          the Personal Data to provide our services to our customers, and (iv)
          the types and sensitivity of Personal Data being processed.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
          Personal Data, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is
          not possible (for example, because your Personal Data has been stored
          in backup archives), then we will securely store your Personal Data
          and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are a resident of the European Union or the UK, all the
          Personal Data related to you and received and stored by World Wireless
          Solutions are erased after 5 years, save for any Personal Data in
          documents and files we must keep for a longer period under applicable
          laws. For example, we cannot erase personal data appearing on VAT
          invoices before we can delete the invoices from our systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Not for Children</b>
          <br />
          The Website is intended solely for use by individuals 18 years of age
          and older and thus is not directed to children under 18 years of age.
          World Wireless Solutions does not knowingly solicit or collect
          Personal Data from children under 18 years of age.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b> Third-party Websites</b>
          <br />
          In addition to providing access to Offerings, the Website may include
          links to other websites and web services. This Privacy Statement does
          not apply to those websites and services and the privacy practices of
          those websites and services may differ from those described in this
          Privacy Statement. If you submit Personal Data to any of those other
          websites or services, your Personal Data is governed by the privacy
          policies applicable to those websites and services. World Wireless
          Solutions encourages you to carefully read the privacy policy of any
          website or web service you visit.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Revisions and Updates to this Privacy Statement</b> <br /> World
          Wireless Solutions may from time to time revise this Privacy Statement
          in its sole and absolute discretion to reflect changes in our business
          practices or new disclosure requirements under applicable privacy
          laws. If we revise this Privacy Statement, we will notify you by
          posting the updated Privacy Statement on this Website and/or by
          sending you a notification by email, as required by applicable privacy
          laws. Changes to the Privacy Statement will become effective and will
          apply to the information collected starting on the date World Wireless
          Solutions posts the revised Privacy Statement on the Website. If we
          are required by applicable data protection laws to seek your consent
          to any changes in use of your Personal Data described in our updated
          Privacy Statement, then we will do that.
