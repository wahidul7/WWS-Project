        <h2>CONFIDENTIALITY</h2>
        <p>
          In connection with your use of this Website and/or in furtherance of a
          business relationship between you and us (“Purpose”), each of us (the
          “Discloser”) may disclose to the other (the “Recipient”) information
          that the Discloser considers confidential (“Confidential
          Information”). Recipient may use Confidential Information only for the
          Purpose. Recipient must use a reasonable degree of care to protect
          Confidential Information and to prevent any unauthorized use or
          disclosure of Confidential Information. Recipient may share
          Confidential Information with its and its subsidiaries’ and
          affiliates’ employees, directors, agents or third-party
          representatives and contractors who need to know it and if they have
          agreed with either party in writing to keep information confidential
          or who are otherwise bound to maintain the confidentiality of such
          Confidential Information on terms at least as protective as those set
          forth herein.
        </p>

        <p>
          Confidential Information does not include information that: (a) was
          known to Recipient without restriction before receipt from Discloser;
          (b) is publicly available through no fault of Recipient; (c) is
          rightfully received by Recipient from a third party without a duty of
          confidentiality; or (d) is independently developed by Recipient. A
          party may disclose Confidential Information when compelled to do so by
          law if it provides reasonable prior notice to the other party, unless
          a court orders that the other party not be given notice.
        </p>
        <p>
          The terms of this Section 13 will become effective upon your
          acceptance or deemed acceptance of these Terms of Use and will
          continue in effect during the duration of any discussions or
          furtherance of the Purpose. Upon termination of your business
          relationship with us or last disclosure of Confidential Information by
          you or us, whichever occurs later, this Section 13 will be deemed
          terminated, however, each of our respective obligations with respect
          to any previously disclosed or obtained Confidential Information will
          continue with respect thereto until one or more of the conditions in
          the preceding paragraph of these Terms of Use becomes applicable to
          any such Confidential Information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each of us acknowledges and agrees that monetary damages may not be an
          adequate remedy in the event of a breach of this Section 13 by the
          Recipient. Accordingly, you and World Wireless Solutions agree that
          the Discloser, as a non-exclusive remedy, shall be entitled to seek
          equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, in
          the event of breach of this Section 13 of these Terms of Use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Promptly upon termination of this Section 13, the Recipient agrees to
          return or destroy all Confidential Information that the Discloser made
          available to the Recipient. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
          Recipient may keep archival copies of any Confidential Information in
          accordance with its document retention policies provided the Recipient
          maintains the confidentiality of such Confidential Information
          according to the terms herein.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Nothing herein imposes any obligation to proceed with any business
          transaction and does not create any agency or partnership
          relationship. All Confidential Information is provided “AS IS” and
          without any warranty, express, implied or otherwise, including without
          limitation with respect to its accuracy or completeness.
